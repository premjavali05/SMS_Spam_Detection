# SMS Spam Detection üì±‚úâÔ∏è

Welcome to the **SMS Spam Detection** project! This project leverages the power of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** to classify SMS messages as either **Spam** or **Ham** (Legitimate). The solution is designed to minimize unwanted spam messages and enhance user experience.

## üìù About the Project

Spam messages are not only annoying but can also pose security risks. This project provides an automated way to detect and filter out spam messages by:

- Preprocessing SMS data for effective analysis.
- Extracting meaningful features using **TF-IDF Vectorization** or **Count Vectorization**.
- Training Machine Learning models for efficient spam detection.
- Delivered with the higher accuracy rate of **97%**.

**Key Features**:
- Comprehensive text preprocessing.
- Multiple ML models (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression).
- Visual performance analysis.
- Scalable and customizable codebase.
